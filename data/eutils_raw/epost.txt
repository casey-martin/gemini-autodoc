Functions
Uploads a list of UIDs to the Entrez History server
Appends a list of UIDs to an existing set of UID lists attached to a Web Environment
Required Parameters
db
Database containing the UIDs in the input list. The value must be a valid Entrez database name (default = pubmed).

id
UID list. Either a single UID or a comma-delimited list of UIDs may be provided. All of the UIDs must be from the database specified by db. For PubMed, no more than 10,000 UIDs can be included in a single URL request. For other databases there is no set maximum for the number of UIDs that can be passed to epost, but if more than about 200 UIDs are to be posted, the request should be made using the HTTP POST method.

For sequence databases (nuccore, popset, protein), the UID list may be a mixed list of GI numbers and accession.version identifiers. Note: When using accession.version identifiers, there is a conversion step that takes place that causes large lists of identifiers to time out, even when using POST. Therefore, we recommend batching these types of requests in sizes of about 500 UIDs or less, to avoid retrieving only a partial amount of records from your original POST input list.

Optional Parameter
WebEnv
Web Environment. If provided, this parameter specifies the Web Environment that will receive the UID list sent by post. EPost will create a new query key associated with that Web Environment. Usually this WebEnv value is obtained from the output of a previous ESearch, EPost or ELink call. If no WebEnv parameter is provided, EPost will create a new Web Environment and post the UID list to query_key 1.
