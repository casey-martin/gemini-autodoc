Returns UIDs linked to other UIDs in the same Entrez database that match an Entrez query
Checks for the existence of Entrez links for a set of UIDs within the same database
Lists the available links for a UID
Lists LinkOut URLs and attributes for a set of UIDs
Lists hyperlinks to primary LinkOut providers for a set of UIDs
Creates hyperlinks to the primary LinkOut provider for a single UID
Required Parameters
db
Database from which to retrieve UIDs. The value must be a valid Entrez database name (default = pubmed). This is the destination database for the link operation.

dbfrom
Database containing the input UIDs. The value must be a valid Entrez database name (default = pubmed). This is the origin database of the link operation. If db and dbfrom are set to the same database value, then ELink will return computational neighbors within that database. Please see the full list of Entrez links for available computational neighbors. Computational neighbors have linknames that begin with dbname_dbname (examples: protein_protein, pcassay_pcassay_activityneighbor).

cmd
ELink command mode. The command mode specified which function ELink will perform. Some optional parameters only function for certain values of &cmd (see below).

cmd=neighbor (default)

ELink returns a set of UIDs in db linked to the input UIDs in dbfrom.

Example: Link from protein to gene

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680,157427902

cmd=neighbor_score

ELink returns a set of UIDs within the same database as the input UIDs along with computed similarity scores.

Example: Find related articles to PMID 20210808

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&db=pubmed&id=20210808&cmd=neighbor_score

cmd=neighbor_history

ELink posts the output UIDs to the Entrez History server and returns a query_key and WebEnv corresponding to the location of the output set.

Example: Link from protein to gene and post the results on the Entrez History

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680,157427902&cmd=neighbor_history

cmd=acheck

ELink lists all links available for a set of UIDs.

Example: List all possible links from two protein GIs

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&id=15718680,157427902&cmd=acheck

Example: List all possible links from two protein GIs to PubMed

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=pubmed&id=15718680,157427902&cmd=acheck

cmd=ncheck

ELink checks for the existence of links within the same database for a set of UIDs. These links are equivalent to setting db and dbfrom to the same value.

Example: Check whether two nuccore sequences have "related sequences" links.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=nuccore&id=21614549,219152114&cmd=ncheck

cmd=lcheck

Elink checks for the existence of external links (LinkOuts) for a set of UIDs.

Example: Check whether two protein sequences have any LinkOut providers.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&id=15718680,157427902&cmd=lcheck

cmd=llinks

For each input UID, ELink lists the URLs and attributes for the LinkOut providers that are not libraries.

Example: List the LinkOut URLs for non-library providers for two pubmed abstracts.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=19880848,19822630&cmd=llinks

cmd=llinkslib

For each input UID, ELink lists the URLs and attributes for all LinkOut providers including libraries.

Example: List all LinkOut URLs for two PubMed abstracts.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=19880848,19822630&cmd=llinkslib

cmd=prlinks

ELink lists the primary LinkOut provider for each input UID, or links directly to the LinkOut provider's web site for a single UID if retmode is set to ref.

Example: Find links to full text providers for two PubMed abstracts.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=19880848,19822630&cmd=prlinks

Example: Link directly to the full text for a PubMed abstract at the provider's web site.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=19880848&cmd=prlinks&retmode=ref

Required Parameter – Used only when input is from a UID list
id
UID list. Either a single UID or a comma-delimited list of UIDs may be provided. All of the UIDs must be from the database specified by dbfrom. There is no set maximum for the number of UIDs that can be passed to ELink, but if more than about 200 UIDs are to be provided, the request should be made using the HTTP POST method.

Link from protein to gene.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680,157427902,119703751

Find related sequences (link from nuccore to nuccore).

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=nuccore&db=nuccore&id=34577062

If more than one id parameter is provided, ELink will perform a separate link operation for the set of UIDs specified by each id parameter. This effectively accomplishes "one-to-one" links and preserves the connection between the input and output UIDs.

Find one-to-one links from protein to gene.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680&id=157427902&id=119703751

For sequence databases (nuccore, popset, protein), the UID list may be a mixed list of GI numbers and accession.version identifiers.

Find one-to-one links from protein to gene.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680&id=NP_001098858.1&id=119703751

Required Parameters – Used only when input is from the Entrez History server
query_key
Query key. This integer specifies which of the UID lists attached to the given Web Environment will be used as input to ELink. Query keys are obtained from the output of previous ESearch, EPost or ELInk calls. The query_key parameter must be used in conjunction with WebEnv.

WebEnv
Web Environment. This parameter specifies the Web Environment that contains the UID list to be provided as input to ELink. Usually this WebEnv value is obtained from the output of a previous ESearch, EPost or ELink call. The WebEnv parameter must be used in conjunction with query_key.

Link from protein to gene:
elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&query_key=<key>&WebEnv=<webenv string>

Find related sequences (link from protein to protein):
elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=protein&query_key=<key>&WebEnv=
<webenv string>
Optional Parameter – Retrieval
retmode
Retrieval type. Determines the format of the returned output. The default value is ‘xml’ for ELink XML, but ‘json’ is also supported to return output in JSON format.

idtype
Specifies the type of identifier to return for sequence databases (nuccore, popset, protein). By default, ELink returns GI numbers in its output. If idtype is set to ‘acc’, ELink will return accession.version identifiers rather than GI numbers.

Optional Parameters – Limiting the Output Set of Links
linkname
Name of the Entrez link to retrieve. Every link in Entrez is given a name of the form

dbfrom_db_subset.

The values of subset vary depending on the values of dbfrom and db. Many dbfrom/db combinations have no subset values. See the list of Entrez links for a listing of all available linknames. When linkname is used, only the links with that name will be retrieved.

The linkname parameter only functions when cmd is set to neighbor or neighbor_history.

Find all links from gene to snp.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=gene&db=snp&id=93986

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=gene&db=snp&id=93986&linkname=gene_snp_genegenotype

term
Entrez query used to limit the output set of linked UIDs. The query in the term parameter will be applied after the link operation, and only those UIDs matching the query will be returned by ELink. The term parameter only functions when db and dbfrom are set to the same database value.

holding
Name of LinkOut provider. Only URLs for the LinkOut provider specified by holding will be returned. The value provided to holding should be the abbreviation of the LinkOut provider's name found in the <NameAbbr> tag of the ELink XML output when cmd is set to llinks or llinkslib. The holding parameter only functions when cmd is set to llinks or llinkslib.

Optional Parameters – Dates
These parameters only function when cmd is set to neighbor or neighbor_history and dbfrom is pubmed.

datetype
Type of date used to limit a link operation. The allowed values vary between Entrez databases, but common values are 'mdat' (modification date), 'pdat' (publication date) and 'edat' (Entrez date). Generally an Entrez database will have only two allowed values for datetype.

reldate
When reldate is set to an integer n, ELink returns only those items that have a date specified by datetype within the last n days.

mindate, maxdate
Date range used to limit a link operation by the date specified by datetype. These two parameters (mindate, maxdate) must be used together to specify an arbitrary date range. The general date format is YYYY/MM/DD, and these variants are also allowed: YYYY, YYYY/MM.
