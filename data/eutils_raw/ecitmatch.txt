Function
Retrieves PubMed IDs (PMIDs) that correspond to a set of input citation strings.

Required Parameters
db
Database to search. The only supported value is ‘pubmed’.

rettype
Retrieval type. The only supported value is ‘xml’.

bdata
Citation strings. Each input citation must be represented by a citation string in the following format:

journal_title|year|volume|first_page|author_name|your_key|

Multiple citation strings may be provided by separating the strings with a carriage return character (%0D). The your_key value is an arbitrary label provided by the user that may serve as a local identifier for the citation, and it will be included in the output. Be aware that all spaces must be replaced by ‘+’ symbols and that citation strings should end with a final vertical bar ‘|’.
